    <h1>About Myself</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am a computer programmer who teaches at Lynn Vocational
       Technical Institute.  I have been a teacher for 12 years,
       before which I was a programmer at Mathworks in Natick from 
       1999-2009. I also had a few interesting jobs in between being
       a programmer as I transitioned to becoming a teacher.  I 
       substituted as a teacher during the day while being a computer
       operator at Paychex in Reading at night.  I also had a summer
       job at Solimine Metals on the Lynnway for a summer, bailing 
       large chunks of metal in compressors.  
    </p>
    <p> I am really interested in networking to reach out in interested
        companies that would like to hire my students, and even finding 
        professionals interested in letting us know what they are looking
        for in candidates that would encourage them to hire our graduates.
        I think most people would be surprised at how skilled our students 
        are at web building considering how much time in school they have
        worked at their trade. 
    </p>
    <p> I am also interested in any company that would be willing for us to do 
        live work on their website either as an initial start (company hasn't 
        had resources to dedicate to making a web presence) or doing 
        enhancements they don't have the time or money for. We have worked
        on two public websites that have given our students valuable experience
        and I would like to expand that list.  
    </p>
